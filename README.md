Step 1: Go to our [studio](https://studio.cedalio.com) and follow these steps:

A. Create a project with the "todo" schema from the Cedalio Template Library.

B. Deploy the schema.

C. Copy the Project ID and set it as `REACT_APP_CEDALIO_PROJECT_ID` in the `.env.development` file.

Step 2: Create a `.env.development` file with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_WC_PROJECT_ID=WALLET-CONNECT-ID
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_NET_SCAN_BASE=https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/ (or your selected network scan)

```


Step 3: Run `npm start`
